Design Document

Wes Reed, Ben Romig, Kaitlin Vo, and Dev Agrawal

## Introduction

Have you ever tried to share music with a friend but they didnâ€™t use the same streaming service as you? (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music) With Music Link, you can:
* Build a playlist that can be opened from any streaming platform
* Share that playlist to your friends
* Collaborate on a playlist with your friends, regardless of what platform they use
